Nineteen-year-old Billy has been thrown 20 feet from his motocross bike during a race, suffering multiple spinal injuries, and he's lost sensation from the chest down.\n\nHe's been transferred from a hospital in Brighton to St George's for treatment by the specialist neurosurgical team. Billy's parents and brothers witnessed his crash and are by his bedside, braced for the worst.\n\nMeanwhile, 53-year-old teacher Dave has facial injuries after riding his new bicycle into the back of a stationary car in Richmond Park. The crash is a wake-up call for Dave. 'It makes you realise you are quite vulnerable,' he says. 'Maybe I'll go back to golf and fishing!'\n\nAnd 30-year-old adrenaline junkie and ex-Royal Marine Richard has badly dislocated his thumb after falling off a bicycle. As the emergency team try to realign the tip of his thumb, Richard enjoys the effects of the pain-killing gas and air while reflecting on his time in the marines and the evolutionary benefits of risk.",
